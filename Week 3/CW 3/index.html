                Fun Facts About Milk Frogs
            </h1>
            <p id = "one">1. Amazon milk frogs are found in the 
                tropical rainforests of South America.</p>
                
                <p id = "two">2.These amphibians received the name "milk frog" 
                    from the sticky white substance they secrete 
                    through their skin when threatened. This substance
                     is poisonous to potential predators.</p>
            <p id = "three">3. Milk frogs are arboreal, and spend their lives in 
                trees and other plants. Milk frogs have special 
                toe-pads on their feet to help them climb plants.
                 They can hold up to 14 times the animal's body weight!</p>
